# PAH8002
In the future this is supposed to be an Arduino library for the optical heart rate monitor found in the SMA-Q2 smartwatch.

At the moment the functions from the application note AN32 have been transferred to .h and .cpp files and some minor cleanup has been performed. Feel free to contribute and let me know how far you got. Discussion taking place here:

Contains a precompiled library (PAH8002HRmon). A tutorial on its usage in the Arduino IDE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0W65KbaeA8&t=1095s
